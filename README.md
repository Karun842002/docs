# Overview
DeepSqueak is a USV detection and analysis software suite that can perform human quality USV detection and classification automatically, rapidly, and reliably using cutting-edge regional convolutional neural network architecture (Faster-RCNN). DeepSqueak was engineered to allow non-experts easy entry into USV detection and analysis yet is flexible and adaptable with a graphical user interface and offers access to numerous input and analysis features. 

# Installation

DeepSqueak v3 relies on recently introduced neural network architecture and will only run on MATLAB 2020a or later.
To install MATLAB follow the instruction at https://in.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html

### Required Matlab toolboxes:
```
Computer Vision System Toolbox™
Curve Fitting Toolbox™
Image Processing Toolbox™
Deep Learning Toolbox™ (formerly Neural Network Toolbox™)
Parallel Computing Toolbox™
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™
Signal Processing Toolbox™
```

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/DrCoffey/DeepSqueak.git
```

To run DeepSqueak, navigate to the main DeepSqueak folder in MATLAB, and type "DeepSqeak" into the command line. DeepSqueak will add itself to the MATLAB path after running.

### Troubleshooting
```
Q : DeepSqueak V3 requires MATLAB 20201 or later. It looks like you are use MATLAB
A : Update MATLAB to the latest version
```
```
Q : Toolbox not found
A : 1. Launch the MATLAB Installer
    2. Choose the necessary toolboxes.
    3. Install the toolboxes.
```
